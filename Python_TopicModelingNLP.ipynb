      "[' Kenya\\'s President Uhuru Kenyatta has said he wants to see an end to Female Genital Mutilation by the end of his time in power in 2022.\\nHe was speaking to the Women Deliver conference in Vancouver, Canada, and his official Twitter account quotes him as saying that he hopes \"to put an end\" to FGM:AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads\\nFGM has been against the law in Kenya since 2011 but the practice continues.\\nCampaign group 28 Too Many\\xa0says that one in five Kenyan women between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone FGM but the numbers are falling.\\nThe president did not outline how reducing the rate to zero will be achieved.\\nMr Kenyatta also pledged to help make Kenya are more equal society when it comes to the treatment of women.\\n\"We need to make the society understand that women are as capable as men. We have to create an enabling environment and the opportunity for them to serve,\" his Twitter account quotes him as saying. ', ' Ancestral curses, bad omens in the family, death of children during birth and sexual perversion are some of the myths used to coerce girls into female genital mutilation.\\xa0\\nOthers are that excision is essential for fertility and the procedure cleanses and beautifies the female genitalia, and that the clitoris will grow to the size of a penis if not cut.\\xa0\\nDuring a media session on training and advocacy on communications and advocacy on FGM, Equality Now media lead Sarah Wambui said sometimes women and girls are told their genitalia is dangerous and would affect their wellbeing if not eliminated.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nDr Tatu Kamau filed a petition in 2017 seeking to legalise FGM arguing there is a discrimination between male and female circumcision.\\xa0\\nThe case will be heard today (Thursday) and tomorrow (Friday).\\xa0\\nShe is also seeking interpretation of whether or not the right of women to uphold and respect their culture was violated by the enactment of the FGM Act 2011.\\nAlso at the centre of her petition is whether or not the Anti-FGM board was illegally created and serves to infringe on the rights of women as enshrined in the Constitution.\\nThe Prohibition of FGM Act 2011 forbids clitoridectomy, excision and infibulation which are the common types of FGM.\\xa0\\nClitoridectomy is the partial or total removal of the clitoris or the prepuce. Excision is the partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora. \\nInfibulation is the narrowing of the vaginal orifice with the creation of a covering seal by cutting and repositioning the labia majora. \\nChanging FGM trends such as cutting at a younger age, cross-border cutting and medicalization have been identified as challenges to the President\\'s ambition to end FGM by 2022.\\xa0\\nData from UN Women show at least 200 million women and girls in 30 countries have undergone the cut - the majority of the cuts were before the age of five.\\xa0\\n\"28 per cent of women who have undergone FGM in Kenya between ages 20-24 were cut at age 5-9, compared to 17 per cent who have undergone FGM between age 45-49,\" Wambui said.\\xa0\\nMedical professionals are also increasingly performing FGM in public or private hospitals or are invited to the girl\\'s home.\\xa0\\nAccording to the Population Council, in 2017 Kenya and Guinea had the third highest rate of medicalized FGM globally at 15 per cent.\\xa0\\n\"The medicalization of FGM in Kenya is a trend that has been documented, particularly among the Kisii,\" Wambui said.\\n\"Some doctors set up temporary “clinics” during school holidays. Girls might be taken to medical facilities under the pretext of suffering from an ailment only for them to be cut.\"\\nLegal advisor Esther Waweru unlike in male circumcision, health practitioners are not allowed to perform the cut on women.\\xa0 ', ' A two-front campaign made up of Maasai elders and Young Champions is fighting female genital mutilation in Taita Taveta county.\\nElder Yohanna Ngukula said the combined effort had reduced FGM in the area. Young Champions is a community sensitisation group.\\n“Some of our cultural practices have been overtaken by events and we are now sensitising our people to accept change. We want them to embrace new technology, education, turn to religion and shun FGM,” Yohanna said at a cultural ceremony in Mbuyuni, Taveta.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads\\nAnother elder, Lazaro Lekeni, said FGM was secretly done by some unscrupulous midwives during childbirth.\\nFGM is widely practised in Taita Taveta. The county is one of the 17 FGM hotspots in Kenya. Civil society groups estimate that 60 per cent of women in the county are cut.\\xa0\\nThe areas where it is most prevalent are Mata, Timbila, Salaita, Kishushe, Wundanyi, Maungu and Miasenyi.\\n\\xa0\\nAnti-FGM champion Irene Nyantika said three types of FGM are practised in the region.

Although the Maa people argue that FGM is part of their culture aimed at bonding their units based on age and gender, the government sees it as a retrospective and backward, saying it interferes with the growth and education of girls.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by TeadsMost FGM survivors the Star interviewed do not blame their parents for allowing their girls to be cut but accuse the community leaders and customs that dictate their destiny. For example, if a girl is the firstborn in a family and is followed by a son, the son cannot be circumcised before the firstborn. They claim it is a taboo and any family disobeying the dictates of the community risk being banished.A case in point is that of Selina Sopiato from Olgulului group ranch in Loitokitok. She was forced to undergo FGM to open the way for her younger brother to be circumcised. Sopiato’s father was opposed to her daughter’s genital mutilation, and the process was delayed for more than 10 years before his agemates threatened to curse him. He had no option but to accept. Sopiato at 17 years was finally cut and her pride brought to an end. Sopiato, a University of Nairobi law graduate, now says she does not blame her parents but the community for driving them into an insane deed. Because of the government’s resolve to end FGM, some families have changed tack and are now doing it under the cover of darkness. Some anti-FGM activists have also introduced an alternative passage for girls into adulthood, which appears to be gaining ground in Narok and Kajiado counties. However, this alternative passage is now being abused as some parents cheat the process. They either cut their daughters before or after they have undergone the alternative rites.Kenya banned FGM in 2011, but it appears the fight against this injurious practice is not making gains because it lacks goodwill from residents. Those still propagating FGM have banned ceremonies and are now cutting their daughters secretly without letting ‘outsiders’ know what is going on.In the absence of goodwill from the people, the fight against these outdated practices will continue for many generations to come.WOMEN DEFEND CUT In December 2015, police raided a house in Kajiado and arrested four women. They had just undergone FGM and wore strings on their legs as a sign to the community of their new status. The four were all married but claimed they were not happy because they had not previously undergone FGM.The case died a natural death like many others that involve gender-based violence. The community believes in resolving their issues without involving the police. Anybody attempting to indulge the police on social issues is normally identified as ‘enemy’ of the community. Cases of elderly people marrying minors in most communities in Narok and Kajiado are common. What has been established by government agencies on young girls undergoing the cut is that after the passage of the rite, they tend to believe they have now become women and do not see the reason to continue with their education.When returned to school, they will not feel comfortable learning with uncut girls in the same class because they consider them ‘dirty’. Moranism has also contributed to the maintenance of the cut practice on girls because most of them have vowed not to marry uncircumcised women. There is also this belief that it is a taboo for a girl to get pregnant before undergoing the cut.On June 3, 2014, three journalists were beaten up by pro-FGM women protagonists in Sajiloni, Kajiado Central, on allegations they were working in cahoots with chiefs to end the female cut. The women destroyed property in Sajiloni market, prompting immediate closure of the town by authorities. They shouted that circumcision is their choice and the Constitution should open a leeway for them to continue with their culture.“We cannot afford to abandon the rich culture that we found our forefathers practising. The government should allow as to continue with it,” said Naomi Naserian, 67. Naserian said when a girl is not circumcised, she risks ending up unmarried as suitors shun her. She said uncircumcised women contribute to prostitution as their sex urge is high.

Their rights should not be violated,” Sossion told the Star on phone.According to the law, pregnancy and FGM tests must be approved by parents or guardians.The FGM inspection means the private parts of the girls must be physically examined by a medical practitioner for evidence of the cut.\"After conducting the FGM test, what do you seek to achieve? It will only stigmatize the girls” Sossion said.Parents Association Chairman Nicholas Maiyo echoed the sentiments saying subjecting the girls to FGM inspection infringes on their fundamental rights.He said such tests should only be conducted if a complaint has been filed to the police regarding forceful mutilation of girls.“For a commissioner to issue such a directive, it infringes on the rights of an individual. It’s the same as HIV test. No one should be forced to take a HIV test,”Maiyo said.He said inasmuch as the association is against FGM, the rights of girls suspected to have undergone the cut should not be violated.“Some of these girls undergo the cut voluntarily. If the commissioner finds that all 40 girls in a class have undergone FGM, will he send them away?” Maiyo asked.In defence of his directive, the county boss said girls who undergo the cut feel mature enough to engage in sex, giving rise to the high rate of teen pregnancies.“I will not sit down to watch girls drop out of school because of something avoidable. We need to fight this vice until we see our girls attain quality education just like boys,” he said.The county commissioner said the exercise will be conducted professionally.He said the exercise will be conducted smoothly to avoid students from dropping out of schools once they realized they are pregnant.According to Natembeya, qualified officials drawn mainly from the health department will undertake the exercise in all the learning institutions in the county.The team also comprises officers from the provincial administration and the education and gender affairs departments.Natembeya said girls found to be pregnant must reveal the identity of men responsible while those found to have undergone the cut must record statements with police identifying those behind the vice.Interestinglythe Federation of Women Lawyers of Kenya lauded commissioner\\'s directive saying it’s a good move towards reducing teen pregnancies and stopping FGM.“It is a good thing actually because FGM is outlawed in Kenya. I know pregnancy tests are a ministry directive but this FGM test is welcome because we need to stop the practice,” said FIDA chairperson Josephine Mong’are.She said parents and relatives are often behind the outlawed practice and subjecting the girls to tests will lead to their arrest and eventually reduce occurrences of the vice over time.“I’m not so sure if it’s a ministry directive but we support it,” Mong\\'are told the Star on phone.Efforts to get a comment from Education CS Amina Mohammed were futile as her phone was off.Last year, the country experienced unprecedented sporadic teen pregnancies during the KCPE and KCSE exam period with statistics indicating that well over 200 girls gave birth during that period alone.In Narok county, more than 60 girls failed to write the exams while over 230 others dropped out after they fell pregnant.Among the affected schools are Suswa Girls, Nkareta primary school and Loita high school.

A rite that provides a foundation for early and forced child marriage. A rite that denies girls the chance to make own choices. A rite that violates the physical and mental integrity of a person.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by TeadsI’m not about to preach about stipulating a new policy to end FGM. No. We have laws in place. Despite their passage almost 10 years ago, FGM is still deeply rooted. The Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act, 2011 bans FGM.A lot needs to be done beyond the existing policies and regulations. It is time to go deeper into the communities where FGM is still practised and address the problem from the source.It is time to dialogue with the community members through separate and blended meetings. It is time to have a candid conversation with the circumcisers; we need to know what drives them to take up such a job.Yes, it is a source of income to some, but do they have another reason as to why they stick to it even after continuous warnings and bans?It is time to dialogue with parents—both males and females. The community gatekeepers such as village elders, heads of clans and the elderly need to be talked into understanding the negative repercussions of FGM.It is common knowledge that the key holders of the communities, who happen to enforce their cultures, are overlooked by the private and public agencies fighting against FGM.That is the reason why the cut is increasingly being conducted at a time when we should be implementing the Big Four agenda and moving towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals. Especially SDG number five: Gender Equality.It is not enough to just rescue girls who are at risk of the cut. Many organisations have done a commendable job providing safe places for such victims to continue their education and even be champions against the vice. But more needs to be done.I had a chance to meet women champions in Isiolo and Kajiado counties who have stood firm against FGM. They have volunteered their time to educate and encourage girls against the cut. These women are taking time to dialogue with parents and circumcisers on the dangers their girls are exposed to in the process of the cut.Community-based organisations such as Il’laramatak Community Concerns have opted to empower their women against the cut with technical skills. Going with their slogan, ‘Cut the Garment, not the Girl,’ the organisation has trained and provided sewing machines to a group of women and their daughters in Kajiado.I believe FGM rates will decline when actionable strategies are used to eradicate it. It will only be possible if a bottom-up approach is adopted; all stakeholders need to come together and tackle the issue from the lowest level of the community. The sole purpose should be to empower girls and women, and end FGM without using forceful tactics.Environmentalist and Founder of www.womennarrate.comCarolinekibii0@gmail.com ', ' Every year, hundreds of girls and young women in Kenya are forced to undergo the cut and often this has been advanced behind the cultural practices. Majority of these young girls are from the pastoralist communities and have often been locked out of education and personal growth.\\nWhile this practice has been safeguarded for generations, men being at the forefront of ending harmful cultural practices is gamechanger in creating more safer spaces for women. Unfortunately, in a report by the World Health Organization, more than 200 million girls and women alive today have been cut in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where FGM is concentrated.\\nAs we continue celebrating strides made in ending female genital mutilation locally and internationally, it is unfortunate that often, men have taken passive roles and not actively participated in ensuring women are safe. While progress has been made, it falls upon men of our own generation to commit themselves fully through partnership and collaboration to ensure the safety and protection of our girls. In the majority of pastoralist communities, the leadership roles have been traditionally occupied by men and having them on the forefront would be transformational in ending FGM and other harmful practices.\\nMen’s absence in many of these initiatives has deepened discrimination against girls and women, there has been gender disparity in enrolment and transition of girls in opportunities from one level to the next, especially among the pastoralists.

He had kept his word! Men like Naileku and Neema’s father deserve commendation for being part of the campaign that is unpacking the complexity and cultural sensitivity of female genital mutilation in their communities.As the world marks the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM tomorrow, the focus this year is to drive concerted efforts to bring everyone to the table to promote the abandonment of FGM under the theme, ‘Ending FGM is my responsibility.’FGM comprises all procedures that involve altering or injuring the female genitalia for non-medical reasons and is recognised internationally as a violation of the rights of girls and women. FGM is mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and 15 years. In Narok county, four out of every five girls undergo FGM. This is more than double the national prevalence at 21 per cent. The Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs, will lead more than 2,000 community members from Kenya and Tanzania, state and non-state actors to mark the day’s events in Loita, Narok.Kenya is making progress in reducing the FGM prevalence. The 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey showed national prevalence had decreased from 32 per cent in 2003 to 27 per cent in 2008-09 and down to 21 per cent by 2014. Similarly, a 2018 study published in the British medical journal, Global Health, showed the prevalence of FGM for girls under the age of 14 had fallen significantly in Kenya. However, the situation is still dire in some communities such as the Somali with 94 per cent, 86 per cent Samburu, 84 per cent Kisii and 78 per cent among the Maasai.The national FGM prevalence reduction has been attributed to the enactment and implementation of the Children Act 2001, Prohibition of FGM Act 2011, policy changes, concerted efforts and investments by the national and county governments, communities, civil society organisations and the UNFPA-Unicef Joint Programme on FGM in Kenya.As we celebrate this progress, a long winding road lies ahead. The complexities of FGM keep changing and we need to be realistic how to handle them. In recent times, there has been an upsurge of medical practitioners performing FGM, known as medicalisation, and families cutting very young girls. The venue and timing has changed and cross-border cutting of girls in Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia and Somalia picked up.We need to have honest and sustained discussions with these communities using a ‘Do No Harm’ principle lens. To reach nomadic communities, we need innovative approaches that include on-site community conversations, empowering teachers as FGM community facilitators and, where applicable, embracing the use of simple mobile texts in the local dialect to provide appropriate FGM information.We need to maintain the pace at the national, county, community and individual level. For Kenya to end FGM by 2030, there are enablers that need to be put in place, including the integration of FGM issues in other sectors. There is a need for sustained community engagement, government investment and evidence-generation and utilisation.

Others are suffering from fistula complication and even fear to tell their story for fear of public rebuke.\\nKajiado county commissioner, David Kipkemei has been a leading campaigner against FGM and has occasionally been a target of attacks by elders, who insist on the practice.\\nKipkemei has used his office and even suspended some chiefs suspected to have aided young girls to undergo FGM and later be married.\\n“As I have always said, I will stand firm against these injurious practices that have been overtaken by time. We want our young girls to get peace of mind so they can concentrate on their education in school,” Kipkemei said.\\nThe commissioner has rescued many girls from early marriage. For instance, late last year in Bissil, Kajiado Central subcounty, Kipkemei rescued a 13-year-old girl after he received information that the Class 8 pupil in Mailua Primary School may not sit her KCPE exam.\\nThe girl managed to sit the exam and was later taken to a children’s home in Kajiado town.\\nMUTILATED ABROAD\\nBut as Kipkemei tries to stamp out FGM and early marriages, a new scheme has been hatched by some communities living along the border.\\nMashuuru deputy county commissioner Stephen Nyakundi told the Star he has been tipped that young girls are smuggled across to Tanzania, where they are circumcised and returned after they have healed.\\n“We are monitoring them very closely. Let them know we are watching them.

It was like a celebration and my two sisters and I were the centre of attention,” says Sein, who has now gone global in her fight against injustices on girls.\\nLASTING DAMAGE\\nSein, talking to the Star from the US, said the equipment they used on her was handmade and was a sharp, curved knife that was not sterilised. She says she was not given any anesthetic before they cut her clitoris. Her wound was treated with herbs, salt and water.\\n“I bled a lot and was in great pain. I was horribly frightened and cried until I passed out. The only other thing I remember before passing out was begging my mum to have the women spare my younger sisters, due to the pain I suffered and never wanted to see my sisters go through it,” Sein said on the phone.\\nWhen she woke up from unconsciousness, her sisters were in the same room with her and were also in great pain.\\n“I came to the US with my husband and about the same time suffered a great deal of pain during my menstrual and urinary tract infection, so I went to the hospital,” she said.\\nShe told the Star it turned out that when they carried out the cut on her, her private parts were damaged.\\nDoctors in the US recommended reconstruction surgery but she was scared and did not want to experience the pain again.\\n“While I was giving birth my doctor had to cut me again and stitch it due to the risk of an un-repairable tear that was caused by FGM,” Sein said.\\nShe said many immigrant minority families in the US take girls to their country of origin to have FGM carried out. The secret event is treated as a family summer vacation; they see family and the countryside and are then circumcised.\\nSein says when the families return to the US, they make sure their girls will never talk about it for fear of state action.\\nThe US government, she says, does not condone such outdated practices on its citizens, and if it is found out, the government will take the girl away from her family, and she will lose all she has in the US, Including family.\\n', ' Sylvia Yeko decided to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM) three weeks ago at the age of 26 - even though the practice, which used to be performed on teenage girls, was outlawed in Uganda in 2010.Her circumcision ceremony took place in public - she showed us a video taken on the day. It shows an excited, cheering crowd surrounding Ms Yeko and another woman, whose faces are smeared with a whitish-brown flour.They lie on bare grass with their legs open as an older woman approaches each in turn and swiftly cuts off their clitoris.Neither of them screams because to do so would be a sign of weakness and would nullify what this community in eastern Uganda regard as a rite of passage before a woman can get married.\"During this day I felt so proud, I just felt so excited,\" Yeko tells the BBC as she watches the footage.\"Before I was circumcised I was taken as any other child, but now I\\'m someone respected.\"FGM convictionsShe knows she could face up to five years in prison for being circumcised, but she insists that she wants to be identified.Those who cut her genitals could be imprisoned for 10 years.Since December, several of these public circumcision ceremonies have happened in the Sebei region of eastern Uganda - most of them in Kween district, which borders Kenya.Three people have recently been convicted for practising FGM, including a 15-year-old girl and a woman. Nineteen others are in jail awaiting trial.FGM is life-threatening. The immediate danger comes from bleeding to death after the genitals have been cut.Then infections can set in. The women in the video also had their private parts covered with flour, and it\\'s not clear if the same blade was used for all the initiates.Later in life, the scars could form keloids, which are growths. Childbirth is also likely to be more difficult.Nevertheless,Yeko has become a sort of celebrity in Sebei - and when I ask if she is concerned that girls and women who follow her example are putting their lives in danger, she says she does not believe FGM is harmful.For her, the act was not only a cultural rite but also a form of protest against the government\\'s failure to keep its promises to help educate and advance prospects for women once circumcision was banned.People in these underdeveloped and poor areas expected to have greater access to social services and infrastructure by giving up FGM.To make her point, Yeko takes me to Kwosir Girl\\'s Boarding Secondary School, where a plaque on the wall reads: \"Presidential pledge to stop FGM\".But she says that even though the school was built in the wake of the circumcision ban and was meant to be free for all girls, costs can run up to $90 (£69) a term and are unaffordable for many in her community.\"They better take back their school because we\\'re not benefiting from the school and we\\'re not enjoying anything from this school,\" she says.Kween is one of the worst-performing areas when it comes to education. According to government statistics, on average, about 6,000 students enrol at primary school level, but by the end of secondary school only 200 students remain in class.Yeko says she did manage to get an education, but like many young people in the East African nation she remains unemployed.A university graduate and now the mother of a four-year-old boy, her decision to get circumcised was to make the point that she feels let down by Uganda\\'s leaders. She even wrote a letter to the police before her cutting ceremony to make sure the authorities knew about it.\\'We are treated like children\\'For another woman, who spoke to the BBC about her recent circumcision, the motive was more personal.Speaking on condition of anonymity, she said she felt ostracised because as a married woman within the ethnic Sabiny community she was prevented from doing certain things because she had not been cut.\"In Sebei, a woman who has not been cut cannot go to the [communal] granary or pick cow dung from the kraal.\"Cow dung is often used to plaster houses, a task often left to women.\"A husband can marry another wife. She might be circumcised and then starts insulting the uncircumcised woman. You are just equated to your children,\" she explained.Yet the mother of three daughters does not intend to circumcise any of them as her hope is that they will be educated and less easily intimidated by the community.\\'She broke the doors\\'Uganda\\'s first female Speaker of Parliament, Rebecca Kadaga, has been a key campaigner against FGM over the last 20 years. She visits the region every year and commissioned the Kwosir Girl\\'s Boarding Secondary School.Kadaga maintains the decision to ban FGM came from the Sebei leaders themselves, who first passed a local by-law in 2009.\"I know that they are unhappy about a number of issues. But I think injuring yourself because there\\'s no road... it\\'s also not right. But I think it\\'s our duty to ensure that they have services,\" she says.The ban has seen the cases of circumcision fall in Uganda. In 2011 1.4% of women were circumcised and by 2016 that had fallen to 0.3%.But Yeko\\'s father, Arapkwures Chemegich, who does not support FGM, says being heavy-handed about the ban will not work and has created pockets of resistance.He should know as he tried to stop his daughter from going ahead with her circumcision.\"When we tried to stop her, she actually fought and broke the door,\" he says, showing me two doors inside the family hut that were hanging off their hinges.\"I think FGM should be stopped, but the method? They should not have come by force.\"It should be something they educate them about.\" ', ' ActionAid is promoting girls’ education in Garissa and fighting FGM and child marriage.Actionaid regional coordinator Yussuf Abdi yesterday said many girls are out of school while an unknown number are facing harmful cultural practices such as female genital mutilation.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by TeadsHe said the aim of the programme, Leave No Girl Behind, is to reduce violence against girls by empowering women’s groups and duty bearers, changing attitudes and increasing justice for survivors. “Women and girls are disadvantaged in society because they are not involved in decision making and inheritance, among others,” he said.

In Kenya, the prevalence of FGM among Somalis is 94 percent, the highest.Sophia regretted that despite the far reaching negative implications for the emotional well being of girls and women, the community continues to embrace the harmful cultural practice.“FGM is a violation of the rights of women and girls as it infringes on their right to privacy and dignity apart from causing pain and harm,” Sophia said.Sophia urged young mothers and girls to rise up and say no to FGM because they are the ones who suffer.Senator Falhadho said she will be tabling a bill in the Senate to compel the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the county government to establish and adequately equip sexual and gender based violence care units in all public health facilities.The bill will also provide for treatment and counselling services for victims of sexual and gender based violence free of charge.It will also put in place coordination mechanisms between health facilities and other agencies involved in addressing sexual and gender based violence. “Through this and many other efforts we are going to scale up the fight against FGM.

We also need to support community engagement and social accountability as we work towards the abandonment of female genital mutilation,” Joyce said.Female genital mutilation is a global public health concern, affecting at least an estimated 200 million girls and women with lifelong damage or complications, including severe pain, excessive bleeding, infections (such as tetanus), urinary problems, psychological problems and life-threatening circumstances for pregnant women and their babies during labour.In addition to its advocacy for enactment and better enforcement of laws against the practice and its health-care worker training, WHO is researching the psychological impacts on girls, women and men in high-prevalence countries to generate evidence for better management of the long-term consequences and for strengthening prevention efforts.

Elias is an activist with the Kenya Men Engage Alliance, which uses contemporary channels to reach out to boys and men to fight the acceptance of female genital mutilation, which is banned in Kenya and 24 other African countries.There is a general perception, says Tony, that the practice is controlled by the mothers, aunties and grandmothers who take young girls, often in secret, to either a traditional circumciser or, increasingly, to health providers. But men, they point out, are complicit.Tony and Elias also believe it will take a critical mass of men to break through the myths.“Men can foster positive beliefs and attitudes and raise awareness on the impact of female genital mutilation to the health of women and girls, which can promote behaviour change in men and boys through the identification and promotion of positive notions of masculinities,” explains Elias.Using films, role models and Twitter, under the tagline #MenENDFGM, both men are demonstrating the harmfulness of female circumcision through candid discussions with boys and men, including religious leaders.“That boy we ignored 15 years ago while sensitizing the community is possibly a young man who now supports female genital mutilation,” says Tony of the need to overlook no one.Dr Joyce Lavussa, a reproductive health expert with the World Health Organisation (WHO), is optimistic that the increased high-level advocacy efforts by such men as Tony and Elias will greatly broaden the needed awareness on the damaging effects of female genital mutilation.The targeted advocacy campaigns with men and the enforcement of policies, laws and guidelines (typically by men), with an emphasis on multidisciplinary and multisector approaches, she says are concrete and realistic efforts in the fight against female genital mutilation.“We need to provide both the technical and financial support for systems strengthening. We also need to support community engagement and social accountability as we work towards the abandonment of female genital mutilation,” says Dr Lavussa.Female genital mutilation is a global public health concern, affecting at least an estimated 200 million girls and women with lifelong damage or complications, including severe pain, excessive bleeding, infections (such as tetanus), urinary problems, psychological problems and life-threatening circumstances for pregnant women and their babies during labour.In addition to its advocacy for enactment and better enforcement of laws against the practice and its health-care worker training, WHO is researching the psychological impacts on girls, women and men in high-prevalence countries to generate evidence for better management of the long-term consequences and for strengthening prevention efforts.WHO and UNICEF estimate that more than 3 million girls younger than 15 years are annually at risk of female genital mutilation or cutting. The procedure entails the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia and other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.“Sadly, men are made to believe that marrying an uncircumcised girl is like marrying a baby,” says Tony. “We need to challenge this status quo. I urge the men to join in this fight, and together we can bring the generational change we yearn for,” he adds.- Article by WHO Regional Office for Africa. ', ' The government must devolve the fight against female genital mutilation if the war is to be won.Prof Olive Mugenda told the Star that on several occasions, decisions are made by people in Nairobi, who may not be on the ground to know if they are implemented.“If the governors and woman representatives can get into the fight and get to the bottom of the matter I think that can help,” Mugenda said.She said the practice is rampant in the interior and far counties such as Baringo, Garissa, Isiolo and Taita Taveta and doing it a local level will go a long way in the fight.“Kenya should make sure the law is followed because those breaking the law in the name of culture should also be dealt with,” she said.The scholar said because of the government’s resolve to end FGM, some families have changed tack and are now doing it in the darkness.Public Service CS Margaret Kobia said in the absence of goodwill from the people, the fight against the outdated practice will continue for many generations to come.

Female circumcision is initiated and carried out by women who see it as a source of honour. They believe that failing to take their girls through the procedure exposes them to ridicule and marginalisation.\\nIn most communities in Kenya, once a girl has gone through the cut, they are deemed 'ripe' for marriage. Their parents get them suitors, mostly older men. Few communities allow the girls back to school after circumcision.\\nKenya outlawed FGM in 2001. A second set of laws passed in 2011, making it illegal to promote or facilitate what used to be known as female circumcision. This also came with stiffened penalties.\\nIn 2013, following the enactment of the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act, the Anti-FGM Board was established as a semi-autonomous government agency.\\nThe mission of the board was to uphold the dignity and empowerment of girls and women in Kenya through the coordination of initiatives, awareness creation and advocacy against FGM.\\nCOMPREHENSIVE LAWS\\nThrough the board and different NGOs that have come up, the country continues to spearhead efforts to curb the internationally condemned ritual with the most comprehensive anti-FGM legislation in East Africa.\\nBoys are encouraged to participate in alternative rites of passage in the home, so that information imparted to them during anti-FGM training sessions will empower them to make informed appropriate choices concerning their future.

', \" The doctor who has practised medicine for 31 years said FGM in an African set up is meant to reduce promiscuity and sexual desire among women.Dr Kamau was testifying in a case where she is challenging the government’s decision to ban FGM in 2011.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by TeadsHer case is being opposed by a number of NGOs among them FIDA, CREAW and Equality Now.\\xa0Dr Kamau says that her culture and cultural practices are protected by the Constitution and stopping her people from practising FGM will amount to a violation of her rights.“Every citizen has a right to equality and freedom from discrimination but the said Act shows open intolerance to women who wish to undergo female circumcision even for the purposes of upholding their culture,” she said.She cites Article 19 of the Constitution which seeks to protect the dignity of an individual or communities.\\n\\xa0\\nIn her view, the authors of the Constitution left it open for an individual to interpret what will dignify them. In her case, undergoing FGM both as a culture and rite of passage dignifies her.“If an adult woman feels that she will be dignified by going through FGM or celebrating her culture that should be protected,” Dr Kamau said.However, she argues that the excesses of a cultural practice ought to be limited and not abolished altogether.For example, she suggested that a more inclusive approach would be to retain FGM but put in place measures such as the age at which it should be done, how it should be done and who does it.She takes the view that the use of the word ‘mutilation’ instead of circumcision is malicious and meant to denigrate her culture and misrepresent it.“Your honour, the use of the term mutilation is offensive to any of us who hold the cultural practice to heart.“Mutilation presupposes malice. Women were not taking their daughters for destruction, it is a rite of passage which we celebrate,” she said.Dr Kamau further complained that the government came up with law abolishing FGM without subjecting it to public participation and therefore it shouldn’t be allowed to stand.She believes that FGM has a medical benefit of hygiene.But she agreed with lawyer Sophie Rajab that FGM compromises or completely obliterates biological functioning of a woman’s genitalia depending on how it’s done.She noted that some extreme type of FGM results in difficulty during childbirth.Under that 2011 law, anyone found conducting FGM is liable to imprisonment ranging from three years to a life's jail term.It even criminalises a person who ridicules a woman who has not undergone the cut or abuses a man who marries such a woman.The punishment for the offender is three years in jail or a fine of Sh200,000.A former police officer John Koech also took to the witness dock in support of FGM.\\xa0Koech said FGM should not be demonised because it is an Abrahamic covenant from God.He told the court that both he and his wife have undergone the cut throwing everyone into laughter.“Hii kitu inaitwa mutilation hatuna.

But this is the truth and it is important this is addressed by the Interior ministry,\" KPA chair Nicholas Maiyo\\xa0 said. ', ' We felt there was room for an analysis of what the court itself said in the recent case about decriminalisation of homosexual activity.\\nWe do not have space to discuss uncertainties about meaning, so take as our starting point that the law makes it a crime for men to engage in sexual activity with each other. Almost certainly it does not make sexual activity between women a crime.\\nIs that law unconstitutional?\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nUnder Article 27, no one is to be discriminated against. There is a list of specific reasons that might be used to discriminate (including race, sex, belief, and dress). But this is not the complete list but just examples.\\nThe people who brought this case to court (the petitioners) argued that the law discriminates against gay people. The Court said essentially “no it doesn’t; look - one section says it is a crime for any person to have sexual intercourse in a certain way and the other says it is a crime for any male to do certain things. So it does not discriminate against gay men in either section.”\\nHeterosexual couples can express their attraction to each other in a variety of ways, including sexual intercourse, which the law has no problem with.\\nBut homosexual couples do not have this possibility. Anal intercourse is prohibited by Section 162 and, for men, other forms of satisfaction by Section 165 of the Penal Code. So the law makes it impossible for gay couples to get sexual satisfaction in their relationship. They are discriminated against.\\nNot only is this common sense, but it is also in Article 27(4): “Indirect discrimination” is prohibited.\\nIndirect discrimination occurs when the law does not say clearly that certain categories of people cannot have or do something but that is the practical effect. That is the situation here – the law hits gay men harder than anyone else.\\nBYPASSING ARTICLE 24\\nGenerally, we cannot insist on our rights regardless of the public interest. For a valid purpose (compatible with a democratic society “based on human dignity, equality and freedom”) the law may limit most rights.\\nBut a court must look at the right, at the social purpose served by limiting it, and whether it would be possible to achieve the social purpose without limiting the right so much.\\nThese judges know all this perfectly well, but managed to avoid carrying out this analysis, which would have required them to ask “what is the purpose being served by this law?”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThey used Article 45 that stresses the importance of the family and says everyone has the right to marry — someone of the opposite sex. By the way, it does not say “gay marriage is banned”; Parliament could constitutionally pass a law legalising gay marriage.\\nWe agree, however, that the Constitution makers were not prepared to suggest that anyone had the right to marry someone of the same sex. That right would have made the Marriage Act definition of marriage as “union of a man and a woman”, unconstitutional.\\nBut the court says Article 45 also makes it impossible to allow gay sex. It reads Article 45 as if it said “You have no right to have sex with anyone of the same gender”.\\nBut we all know sex and marriage do not necessarily go together. Adultery is not a crime. And though, as the court says, a long-term sexual relationship may be treated like marriage for some purposes, it never becomes a marriage and is not ended by divorce. The “thin end of the wedge” argument is not convincing.\\nWhy does the Constitution focus on gay marriage? Surely it is because people have been resistant to the idea of a formalised union between gay people, especially one called “marriage”. Many have felt that it was somehow sacrilegious to allow gay couples to enjoy it. ', ' The court said if nothing prevented Kenyans expressly allowing same-sex relationships in the Constitution.”But nothing prevented them from declaring gay sex prohibited, as opposed to only excluding a right to gay marriage. In such a situation is not the best approach to restrict ourselves to what the Constitution says, not embellish it?WHY CRIMINALISE?If the court had not evaded Article 24 in this way, the first question would have been, “What is the purpose of criminalising homosexual activity?”The origin of the provision is in late 19th Century English law and social attitudes. Hardly justification for the 21st Century Kenyan law.One argument would have been: “to preserve Kenyan culture”. Preserving culture is a legitimate constitutional objective.But what does “This is not Kenyan culture” mean? Many cultures — not all — have frowned on homosexual activity – and not only in Kenya or Africa. Very few cultures have positively embraced homosexuality activity.But is “This is not our culture” more than saying, “We are intolerant of people with different ideas and habits”. Is this a commendable aspect of anyone’s culture?The Constitution is clear that culture must not be contrary to human rights.And our President has said he hopes to see FGM eliminated during his term in office.Yet clearly, FGM is an obstinately persistent part of many Kenyan cultures. We all, the courts especially, know that culture is important but not sacrosanct.Is it because gay sex does not produce children? But we don’t criminalise sex using contraceptives, sex in old or sex for the infertile.Is it because gay sex is against religion? But we have freedom of religion. No religion (even under the guise of “God Bless Kenya”) is written into the Constitution.In reality, is it not because of a combination of distaste and difficulty in accepting someone who is different?The Constitution is clearly against the idea that it is acceptable to discriminate against just because they are different.And as for distaste, first of all the solution is not to bother yourself about what people do in their bedrooms. And secondly what makes disgust a valid reason for penalising people?Beyond these reasons, what justification could there be for penalising consenting adults for their sexual preferences?IS CHOICE RELEVANT?The court said, “The expert evidence was unanimous that there is no conclusive scientific proof that LGBTIQ people are born that way”. Quite apart from the fact that intersex people (the I in LGBTIQ) are indeed born that way, one could equally say that evidence does not show that gay people are not born that way.But this is of marginal relevance. True, if you have no choice about the way you are it is particularly unfair that you are discriminated against on that basis.But the Constitution does not outlaw discrimination only on the basis of inborn, involuntary characteristics.Dress, religion, political opinion, marital status and, usually, pregnancy are choices. Yet it is against the Constitution to discriminate against anyone because they have one of those characteristics - unless there is an Article 24 good reason.So why does it matter whether people are born or choose to be gay? When the court said “if they were born that way, they have rights like everyone else” it was totally misguided.HUMAN RIGHTS ARE NOT A MATTER OF MAJORITY VOTEWhat the majority thinks is all right does not need protection in the Bill of Rights. It is the unpopular who need protection.The unwelcome expression of a view is protected under Article 33, the believer in a religion you preach against is protected under Article 32, the person with albinism is protected perhaps under Article 54 (though this is not quite right since albinism is not a disability) regardless of what you believe about causes of albinism.These judges know that, too. When they said “the desire of Kenyans, whether majoritarian or otherwise are reflected in the Constitution” they were ignoring the fact that the desire of Kenyans is expressed to be that everyone is treated with respect, equality and for a society in which everyone is included and no-one marginalised.The writers are lawyers ', ' More: ', ' A section of MPs from Western have asked the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to dig deeper to get the truth about the assassination plot on the Deputy President William Ruto instead of engaging in arbitrary arrests to divert the attention of Kenyans from the ‘real issue’.\\nThe MPs Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), Geoffrey Omuse (Teso South), Janet Nangabo (Women Rep, Trans Nzoia), John Waluke (Sirisia), Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula) and James Mukwe (Kabuchai) expressed outrage at the manner in which DCI George Kinoti was carrying out investigations over the matter.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads\\nThey said the arrest of Dennis Itumbi, a Digital Director at the presidency, was part of the diversionary tactics being employed to cover up part of the agenda of the meeting held at the Hotel La Mada.\\nSpeaking at Sirisia and Teso South Constituencies in Bungoma and Busia Counties during a tour to inspect development projects by the Deputy President on\\xa0Friday, the legislators demanded investigations to establish the agenda of the meeting.\\xa0\\nBarasa said DCI officers should stop concentrating on the letter purporting that some Cabinet Secretaries were planning to assassinate the Deputy President and instead focus their energies on individuals who uttered words that appeared to be a plot against the Deputy President.\\n“Instead of DCI investigating individuals who talked ill of the Deputy President, they are now focusing their attention on the letter,” added Mr Barasa.\\nWaluke said God and Kenyans would protect the Deputy President from any assassination attempt, saying those plotting such evil deeds would not succeed.\\n“We want to tell DCI that even if they arrest all the allies of the Deputy President, they will not succeed in stopping the presidency of Dr Ruto.

You can imagine my disappointment when there was no such thing.\\nLook, I do not know about you, and do not get me wrong, I was not the greatest student, especially in Biology, but I remember in Form Two (we learnt the best part of biology then, that is why I was keen) our teacher told us about the possibility of women birthing twins with different fathers. So, forgive me if this does not mesmerise me.\\nAlso, I know that this was not the reason the link was sent to me, because I got it from a couple of other men trying to ‘sex shame’ women. Wanawake wa siku hizi. One man was bold enough to castigate said mother of twins for daring, nay, having the audacity to sleep with two men that closely. It angered him more that the woman was married. She had had a one night stand you guys.\\nThe level of hypocrisy made me throw up a little in my mouth. Fine she is a married woman, she went astray and should be forgiven, like the countless husbands who are forgiven daily even when they come back with souvenirs from their philandering ways. I cannot judge.

We both have consensual sex, but at the end of it, I am a slut, you are a man. No, at the end of it, I am still a woman, you are still a man. You cannot turn around and try to cheapen a woman. Unless you are cheap and it is sexually transmitted. In which case, you need to declare your cheap status before coitus.Before you raise your pitchforks and branding irons to label me a feminist, can I talk to the women too?

Put her picture on his status, even if she is the only one who can see it. Beg and cajole for sex. Promise you the premolar tooth of his firstborn and swear his mother is a witch. Give into his ‘subtle’ advances, he will be telling anyone who cares to hear that you threw yourself at him. And so what if you did, throw yourself at him, why did he catch you? Was it by force?Men who want ‘pure’ women should abstain from having intercourse, with women. This will highly increase the rate at which ‘pure’ women will be found. I guess it is not common knowledge that women have sex with men, and that sometimes women enjoy that sex.A grown woman who has consensual sex should not and must not be shamed. Publicly or otherwise. Let us all mind our genitals. There are many things of public interest that should capture our attention and deserve our outcry.If you insist though on knowing what happens between a woman’s legs, there are girls who still go without sanitary towels, others still going through FGM and more still are raped.

It is important to work out a relationship and learn to sort out issues between yourselves,” he said.\\nWango said there are people who are violent, psychopaths and narcissists, but it is advisable that everyone learns to control their emotions, particularly anger.\\nHe urged people with anger management issues and a temperament to seek help from a counselor before they engage in a relationship.\\n“Learn to pick out anger signs like frequent tantrums, hitting you, breaking objects and general arrogance and a don\\'t-care attitude,”Wango said.\\nSome issues, he said, can turn into crisis, such as mistrust and dishonesty and a cheating spouse, adding that they are signs that something is not right and should be sorted out not fought over.\\n“There could be things that have turned sour, but hitting or worse still killing your spouse is not and never will be a solution. Males must effectively deal with their insecurities, frustrations and disappointments. Instead find out what could be happening, like lack of love or diminished attention, and hence a partner goes out seeking the same,”Wango said.\\n“We need to teach our traditional males to avoid being too egoistic.

The major threat is encroachment, commercial charcoal burning and illegal logging.\\n\"The impact of this human-related degradation has been catastrophic with frequent floods, drought, reduced river flows, food shortage and poor land productivity, among others. This is likely to worsen under the current status of degradation,\" part of the report says.\\nAllowing settlers in the forest would have heightened the clamour for excision for all encroached water towers to the detriment of the current and future generations.\\n\"Excision would heighten the already existing tension between communities, with a potential of it degenerating into a security situation,\" part of the report says.\\nWith the forest cover being 7.2 per cent of landmass, the government dropped the idea altogether.

It also believes that human-wildlife conflicts caused by water scarcity will be resolved.The government also believes that there will be sustainable and increased tourism activities in the Maasai Mara National Reserve as a result of increased water flow.The last option was the removal of all settlers without compensation through notices that they move out voluntarily.Failure to move out would lead to evictions.The government has already given the settlers a 60-day window to start packing and leave the water tower by October 31.The government said it was clear that there has not been an issue that has had so many task forces, hearings, assessments, studies than the MMF.It said all the task forces agreed that those who have encroached on the forest must be removed and the boundaries as established by the Ntutu commission implemented.The government said that having carefully considered all the three options, the only viable option is the removal of all those who have settled in the Maasai Mau.The 1,029 individuals who initially acquired land in the forest through ballooning of the group ranch boundaries will also be held criminally culpable.\\xa0During the first phase evictions which happened in July and August 2018, some 2,400 settlers were targeted in Nkoben and Kass Fm areas.Some 11,119.725 acres (4,500 ha) were recovered.Among those set to be prosecuted include companies and businesses associated with the late senior chief Lerionka ole Ntutu’s family.They are among five group ranches that extended beyond adjudicated boundaries into the forest.Ilngina Contractors Limited —whose directors are Agens Naropil Ntutu ( 490 shares), Kiteleiki Ntutu ( 490 shares) and Kunini Ntutu (20 shares) — extended their boundaries deep into the forest.Izmir Enterprises, whose directors are Sahir Mughal and Asiya Mughal, also encroached the forest.Other companies and business names in the five group ranches that extended beyond their adjudicated boundaries are Kaetoni Enterprises (director Mary Tamooh) and Kesumin Investment ( director Joseph Rotich).Sanyana Enterprises — whose directors are Nathaniel Getonge (four shares) and Pacifica Nyambongo (one share) — also extended into the forest.

', ' Hundreds of Kenyans who had grabbed military land are now counting losses after the National Land Commission revoked their titles.Among those set to part with 4,000 acres of land in Eldoret alone is the little-known entity, claiming to represent squatters-Leseru Tebeson Farmers.NLC by the stroke of a pen has recommended to the chief registrar to revoke the title before vesting the land to the Principal Secretary of Defence, Torome Saitoti.The Commission in its findings noted that the land was originally allocated to the ministry of Defence and reserved as Eldoret military camp where the 9 Kenya Rifles battalion(9KR) and Recruits Training school(RTS).AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by TeadsKenya Ordinance Factories Corporation (KOFC) and buffer zones are also housed there.KOFC is a State Corporation under the Ministry of State for Defence mandated to manufacture Hardware, Machinery and Equipment.During the hearing, NLC was shocked to find that the military which has tanks, guns, jet fighters, helicopter gunships and lots of bullets had lost thousands of acres country wide.During the hearing, the military was categorical that it has not surrendered any of its land to anyone.The military remains one of the largest land owners in the country, an incentive that might have encouraged private developers.Disturbed by land grabbing, Defence ministry complained to NLC through three letters.It wrote to NLC September 6,2018 via letter Ref:MOD/28/18 A and September 18, 2018 via a letter whose reference is Ref:MOD/28/18 A.The ministry also wrote another letter September 27 complaining that some private individuals have hived off their land without their consent.This is despite that was acquired from private individuals by compulsory acquisition under the provisions Land Act in 1970s and early 1980s.\"Indeed the land was compulsorily acquired by the government by gazette notices numbers 2878 and 2879 of 24th September, 1976, gazette notices numbers 710

its mandate from the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the National Land Policy (2009) and acts of Parliament, namely the National Land Commission (NLC) Act, the Land Act and the Land Registration Act, all of 2012.Its broad mandate includes managing of public land on behalf of the national and county governments.It also initiate investigations, on its own initiative or on a complaint, into present or historical land injustices, and recommend appropriate redress.The term of the current NLC is set to come to an end February 19.NLC also waded into Military land that has also been grabbed in other areas such as Nyanyuki, Samburu and Karen, near Deputy President\\'s official residence.During the hearings at the Commission\\'s Annex Offices, the county government of Uasingishu expressed interest in Leseru Tebeson matter.The Commission was told during the hearing that former President Daniel Moi had in 2000 directed that KDF cede some of the land to settle squatters.Following the directive, the interested party said, KDF agreed to surrender 4,236.25769 acres(1,714.39 hectares) from its Eldoret land to Buheba and Kamagut settlement schemes.KDF was then left with a total of 11,988.84 acres of land.However, the land according to the interested party has never been degazetted and military is still in use of the land.KDF during the hearing told the commission that a group known as Leseru Tebeson Farmers Self Help group alias Leseru Tebeson Limited and Leseru Tebeson Farmers Society began emerging from nowhere to claim ownership.Leseru Tebeson Farmers Society claimed they were allocated the parcel through an allotment letter Ref 52945/133 dated February 2006, as squatter upgrading scheme.They told NLC that they paid requisite amount of Sh 11,826,21 through a cheque No. 082854 and issued with receipt No. 52942 dated June 2,2006.The group claimed that they were issued with a title deed registered as IR No. 194659 February 23, 2018.The title, they claimed, was surrendered to Chief land registrar for subdivision into several parcels, the same is still on the process to date.Eleven Kiplombe farms also had interest in the military land.The 11 farms whose members are over 19,000 with an average of three acres each were also casualties of NLC\\'s probe, as their titles were also revoked.The farms include Kiplombe farm limited, Kanetic farm, Kapng\\'etuny farm,Bhemba,Kapkeben,Emdin,Cheplasgei,Tikito,Kapsamoo,Songoliet, and Lewa Downs farm limited.They told NLC that they legally acquired the parcel and they have been utilizing it ever since.NLC would however hear none of their explanations.In a similar strike of a pen, NLC dealt a major blow to Gituamba Enterprises limited, after recommending for revocation of its title.The Military wrote letters Ref MOD/28/18 A dated September 6,2018, MOD/28/18 A September 18 and another one Ref MOD 28/18 A dated September 27.It complained that their land within Kabete military camp had been hived off by private developers.\"The Commission recommends the Chief land registrar to revoke the titles purportedly owned and registered to Gituamba Enterprises limited as they fall within Kabete military camp,\"NLC says.Interestingly, Gituamba Enterprises limited did not appear before the commission but instead sent written submissions through Wambugu and Muriuki advocates.They claimed that the property was acquired in full compliance of the law.Gituamba said that they were issued with a letter of allotment by letter dated December 13, 1991 before making payments worth Sh 104,000.The lawyers said they requested the commissioner of land to grant approval for subdivisions of the plot into three equal parcels through a letter dated June 23, 1992.On February 28, 1995, the lawyers said,the commissioner of lands allotted parcel numbers 209/12345,209/12346 and 209/12345 to them.Gituamba said an application of a new grant over the parcel was received at the department of lands, central registry before grants was prepared and fully registered May 26,1995.They also submitted that they have been in boundary feud with the Defence over boundary issues.Near Deputy President\\'s residence in Karen, 32 land ownership documents have been revoked as they are in military land.Fearing for the worst, interested parties too kept off the hearings despite several attempts to summon themOnly, the military came out to defend their land whose original number is 23047.\"The Commission directs that Chief land registrar revokes the listed parcels and vest the land to PS treasury to hold in trust for the Kenya military,\"NLC says.A similar fate in what will be one of a major trump by the Kenya Defence forces,has hit Mount Kenya Self Help Group.The Defence complained to NLC through three letters Ref MOD/28/18 A dated September 6,2018, MOD/28/18 A September 18 and another one Ref MOD 28/18 A dated September 27.The land in question measures approximately 1,877.96 acres (760 hectares) in Kwa Mbuzi area, Nyanyuki.Mount Kenya Self Help Group just like Gituamba did not show up during the hearings.Aware of the awaiting fate, they did not attempt to submit copies of their submissions even after NLC made several attempts to reach them through Newspaper advertisements.\"The land was reserved for ministry of Defence as Nyanyuki military camp vides gazette notice No. 212 of 27th March, 1957,\"NLC says.The Commission says a letter of allotment Ref No. 189464 of 18th October 2000 was issued by the Commissioner of Lands to military.\"The Commission recommends that the purported subdivisions and or titles issued in respect of portions of this land are null and void and shall be expunged from records, if any, held by the Nyanyuki Land Registrar,\"NLC says.In a boundary dispute pitting Defence and Losesia group ranch in Samburu, NLC directed the two to look for independent surveyor to verify the issue.They have since settled the matter with the ranch undertaking to surrender the title for excision of the encroaching area on military land.

Her voice so sad you can hear the melancholic backdrop if you listen close enough.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nEddah has been married for half her life. Throughout this time, she has been constantly trying to get pregnant for her husband. “He beats me every time I get the miscarriages. It is such a shame in my culture,” she adds tearfully.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThere is much I can tell a semi-literate, highly cultural 17-year-old girl about pregnancy. But now does not seem like the time. Now, in this space and time, I am here to listen. And later tell her story to the world. ', ' Reproductive health has been a part of all African cultures since time immemorial. Yet, we have not fully learnt how some of the harmful reproductive health cultural practices are affecting our communities.Eddah was “given” to a moran before she was circumcised. From age six she started engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse. “In our culture, the moran has to build a manyatta in the girl’s home. This is the place where they spend time together when the moran is in need.“I had not started menstruating at the time. No one even told me about pregnancies and abortions,” narrates Eddah.She went on to have sexual relations with the moran for two years before she was circumcised. It was during circumcision that she learned a few things about pregnancy.She was warned that she couldn’t get pregnant before she is wed as it was a shame to her family and her taboo. “I did not get married immediately after the circumcision. Some girls have to wait a bit to get husband,” she tells. During this time, Eddah had started her menses and soon she got pregnant for the moran.\\n\\xa0\\nEddah told her elder sister that she might be pregnant in an attempt to get a confidant. Her sister, who had just been married off, told her she has to tell their mother. But Eddah was afraid. So she kept quiet. She hid the pregnancy. ', ' “They only came to know about it when I was 2 months pregnant,” she adds. What they did next was tragic. Eddah’s mother called her neighbour, who was also the woman who circumcised Eddah and together, they locked her in one of the family’s manyattas.They came back for her in the middle of the night.\\n\\xa0\\nAs Eddah laid on her back on the ground, the women used a can full of sand to press and hit her baby bump. “All I remember is the first hit.There were 10 women and the first one put the can on my belly and pressed down with her leg. I had not realised that some of the women had pinned me down so I could not move. I asked my mother to stop but I could not even see her face among the women,” she tells.“People in this area rarely talk about how they do their cultural abortions. Much has been done about female genital cutting but there has been a laxity in other detrimental reproductive health practices that many cultures partake in,” adds Dr Louise, Eddah’s gynecologist.Eddah was married off one month after the ordeal. “Her womb is severely damaged and it is possible that it is because of that. We have seen several young women and girls with the same condition here,” confirms Dr Louise.With the recently announced court order that the country will refer to the 2012 Standards and Guidelines for Reducing Morbidity and Mortality from Unsafe Abortion in Kenya when discussing the issue, it is still not clear where cultural practices that lead to abortions fall under.The Standards and Guidelines highlight the importance of educating youth on reproductive health. However, youth like Eddah, who are not only marginalised economically, but also socially and politically are being left behind. It would seem that Kenya is still not yet at the level of discussing pro-life or pro-choice consequences of abortions.We should start with the basics. The first step should be ensuring all girls of reproductive age know their health rights, understand how to lower risk of unwanted pregnancies and have access to quality reproductive health care when needed. This includes girls like Eddah, who live in hardship and whose cultures dictate their fate.

It is a silent problem hugely affecting many\\nwomen and girls and is rarely highlighted by the media, mainly because female\\nvictims fear speaking it out due to stigma.\\nGirl victims are\\nmade to believe they will not get married in life if they consent to have been\\nraped and the incident is publicised. Even the girl\\'s parents have the same\\nmentality to protect their daughters from the shame associated with rape. This\\nis one of the main reasons why rapists walk scot-free because they are not\\nprosecuted.\\nAnother problem\\nblamed for the increased rape cases is the mediation role played by tradition\\nelders. Rape cases are rarely prosecuted as the two families from the victim\\nand perpetrator often agree to settle the matter outside the courts.During those\\ndiscussions, blood money is paid to the victim’s family with a share of the\\nsame proceeds also going to the elders as sitting allowance. No wonder elders\\noften troop into a police station whenever they hear a suspected rapist has\\nbeen arrested to release him because thematter will be settled their way.\\nAll these\\ntraditional taboos end up empowering rapists and killers because\\npsychologically, they know the community or close family members will come to\\ntheir rescue.

We have to go back and see\\nhow the matter was addressed and why it was a rare act in the past.\\nSomalis were traditionally\\nvery reserved people. Rape was a very shameful act and very rare because people\\nobserved and respected traditional norms.

The northern regions\\nhave the fewest cases of rape compared to the south because they still hold\\ninto their old cultures.\\nThe government\\nneeds to enforce prosecution of rape cases to put rapists behind bars and defy\\nthe so-called elders accused of abating these heinous crimes by encouraging out-of-court\\nsettlements. Somalis must also cooperate with authorities and drop old taboos\\nprotecting rapists so as to bring them to justice.\\nAs for murders\\nwho are found guilty, we should continue to treat them as required by Sharia\\nlaw, kill them too.

In the research we are conducting, we are treating young women in South Africa with ARVs immediately they are infected,\" Thumbi Ndung’u, SANTHE programme leader and HPP scientific director says.\\nThe participants in the study are tested twice a week, so we can immediately detect if they are infected. These individuals might be easier to cure,” Ndung’u adds.\\nSANTHE is collaborating in the study with the Females Rising through Education Support and Health (FRESH), a community-based programme that has since 2012 reached out to young women at risk from HIV based in Durban, South Africa. \\nFindings from the study will have a major impact on HIV cure strategies and will help African governments and health officials plan for interventions, drawing on lessons from cutting-edge research in the country with the biggest HIV epidemic in the world.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe basic research science on biological samples from FRESH participants and performed at HPP under Ndung’u’s leadership is based on statistics indicating that young women are very high risk and bear the disproportionate burden of the HIV epidemic. Over two-thirds of 24-year-old women in South Africa are infected with HIV.\\nThe programme enrols local women who are HIV negative. Their blood samples are frequently tested (every two weeks) the HPP to see if anyone has recently contracted the virus. \\nIf they have, they start ARV therapy and, in turn, provide further samples for the study. Most of the young women in FRESH are disadvantaged and a lot of them are out of school, but through the programme they can get economic opportunities, or even go back to school.\\nThere are some interesting preliminary findings from the study. For example, HIV usually depletes a person’s CD4 cells – but not so in these women, if they are treated early. The team is looking to study whether this has long-term benefits.\\nNdung’u’s colleague, Krista Dong, who leads the FRESH study, is collaborating with the SANTHE scientists on a two-pronged prevention strategy clinical trial - enrolling the highest risk group at the epicentre of the HIV epidemic and treating early to provide an opportunity to conduct pure research.\\n“Thumbi Ndung’u and our teams at HPP and FRESH will be implementing a clinical trial focused on “cure” or ‘post-treatment control”, enrolling young women whose HIV infection was detected during their enrolment in the FRESH study,” says Dong adding:\\xa0 \\n“This is a novel treatment that will be given to HIV-infected individuals, that involves a combination of two or three broadly neutralizing antibodies (‘BNAbs’ pronounced bee’-nabs), plus an immunomodulatory agent.” ', ' A FRESH Cohort HIV study has discovered that Black women in South Africa have a different composition of bacteria - a diverse bacteria-microbiome in their vaginal tract - that makes them more vulnerable to HIV infection. \\nData from the study reveal that most of the women use the injectable hormonal contraceptive, which puts them at a higher risk of HIV infection.\\nThe research seeks to understand those factors (the bacterial conditions that puts the women at a higher risk of infection), in the clinical trial that will launch a novel product to alter the composition of the bacteria in the vaginal tract.\\xa0 ', ' It seeks to know how the immune system fails to protect women infected via the membranes at the site in the female genital tract where they are first exposed. With the first marker for infection, immediate treatment will lead to reducing the virus, blunting the peak-time; the most likely of a cure strategy, Dong explains. The cure study will begin in 2020 following the 2019 Lactin V new investigation product the researchers have developed to alter the bacteria in the vaginal tract.Since the young women in the FRESH Cohort Acute HIV study are tested so frequently, HIV infection is picked up within days of exposure and they are started on “immediate” treatment.\\xa0 This means that the ARVs stop viral replication very early, before the levels get very high in the blood and before they establish large repositories or “reservoirs” of virus that cannot be eliminated by drugs alone.\\xa0Because ARV treatment is started very early and limits the size of the viral reservoir, this may present one of the best opportunities to use a novel treatment to eradicate the virus from the body or to help the body to control the virus without drugs (post-treatment control).\\xa0Early treatment research has confirmed that the earlier you start treatment for HIV, the better.\\xa0 Early treatment suppresses the virus in the blood, which prevents further damage to the immune system.\\xa0 Although the immune system is unable to control (suppress) the virus without ARVs, except in rare individuals, once a person stops ARVs, the virus begins to replicate and high levels in the blood return.\\xa0\\xa0In the study, the goal of early treatment is not only to prevent damage to the immune system, but also to limit establishment of the viral reservoir and create a unique cohort of individuals in whom novel cure strategies can be tested.The SANTHE/FRESH study will significantly\\xa0contribute to HIV research and demonstrates that African researchers are conducting cutting edge science in Africa that complement global efforts in the search for a cure for an epidemic that has ravaged the continent.

Unlike other societies such as Japan, which has a huge number of the aged, Kenya’s future is in its children. We must, therefore, protect children’s rights if we are to realise our potential and take Kenya to the next level.To begin with, the government should be more serious in implementing children’s policies. Programmes such as free primary education and laptops should be fully implemented to ensure maximum benefits for the children. A specific police unit should be established to address children cases. Many are the times when police have treated children cases too casually.Parents must take their roles seriously. When parents expose their children to drug abuse and child prostitution, it says a lot about us as a society. Too many single-parent families are evidence of irresponsible parenting. Both parents must be present and visible in children’s upbringing. As a society, we have a duty to do better for our children. ', ' The Nairobi Summit on the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD25) was deemed an overwhelming success with over 9,500 participants from more than 170 countries who came with a shared purpose to achieve the ICPD25 goals.\\nThe summit was concluded on 14th November with partners making bold commitments to transform the world by ending all maternal deaths, unmet need for family planning and gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls by 2030.\\n“The Nairobi Summit represents a renewed, re-energized vision and community working together to act and deliver. Together, we will make the next ten years a decade of action and results for women and girls, keeping their rights and choices at the centre of everything we do,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem.\\nBy the end of the conference, over 1,250 commitments were made by governments, donors, businesses, non-governmental organizations, civil society and other actors to support these goals termed the “three zeros” – zero maternal mortality, zero unmet needs for family planning and zero tolerance towards gender-based violence. ', ' The Summit, co-convened by the governments of Kenya and Denmark with UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, unveiled critical new data about the cost of achieving these goals. It mobilized more than 1,200 commitments from around the world, including billions of dollars in pledges from public and private sector partners. It also raised the voices of marginalized communities, youth and grassroots advocates, who were able to directly engage heads of state and policymakers about how to realize the rights and health of all people.\\nAmong the highlights of the conference was the commitment that by President Uhuru Kenyatta during the official opening of the conference on 12th November.

To track and monitor the implementation of the ICPD25 Nairobi Summit commitments through the National Council for Population and Development in the State Department for Planning; provided that the commitments are in keeping with Kenya’s Constitution, socio-cultural values and national ethos.\"\\nGovernments including Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, together with the European Commission, committed around $1 billion in support. The private sector also stepped in: Children’s Investment Fund (CIF), The Ford Foundation, Johnson & Johnson, Philips, World Vision and many other organizations announced that they will mobilize some $8 billion in combined new pledges.\\n“There will be no ICPD50. Women and girls around the world have waited long enough to have rights and choices,” said Ambassador Ib Petersen, Denmark’s Special Envoy for ICPD25. “Looking towards 2030, we now enter a decade of delivery during which we will walk the talk and hold all of us to account for the commitments we made in Nairobi.”\\nOver 9,500 delegates from more than 170 countries took part in this radically inclusive conference, uniting behind the Nairobi Statement, which establishes a shared agenda to complete the ICPD Programme of Action. ', ' Life is a gift from God, and therefore sacred; it ought not to be taken away through preventable causes, religious leaders have said.\\nThe clerics drawn from Christian, Muslim and Hindu faiths spoke at the All Africa Conference of Churches, during a Religious Actors Pre-summit on International Conference on Population and Development. \\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of the groundbreaking ICPD, which took place in Cairo in 1994. \\nKenyatta International Convention Centre, Nairobi plays host to over 8000 delegates for a three-day global summit. \\nConcerns had been raised about specific areas in the ICPD25 program, including abortion and comprehensive sexuality education in reproductive health (SRHR), and LGBT under demographic diversity. \\nThe religious leaders on Monday from Kenya, other African countries, Latin America, Europe and the USA maintained that religion plays a crucial role in promoting the wellbeing of humanity. ', ' Director of Department of Gender, women and youth at All Africa Conference of Churches Rev. Lydia Mwaniki said religious leaders recognize and prioritise the dignity of every human being. \\n\"We, as religious leaders and faith actors, provide enormous opportunities for and contributions to accelerating the quest for a better world,\" Mwaniki said. \\nIn a joint statement released after the pre-summit, the faith actors expressed concern over the exclusion of their perspectives, especially from the majority world. \\n“We are minimally included in global processes such as ICPD25,” the statement read. \\nThey also decried the use of terminologies, language and winding statements that are unclear and recommended simpler, directly interpreted terms for clear understanding. \\nThe faith actors rebuked the provision of contraceptives to underage girls and boys as a solution to teenage pregnancies.\\n\"Provision of contraceptives to underage girls and boys is not a solution for teenage pregnancies, and certainly not for STIs, nor HIV/AIDS,\" they said. ', '  The leaders insisted many faith communities have educational programs to delay the age of sexual debut and responsibilities for adults. \\nIn a collective voice, they called for concerted interventions to reduce deaths of mothers and children. \\n\"Common and leading causes of maternal mortality especially those related to pregnancy and childbirth are known. However, global commitments lack explicit and practical ways of addressing these causes,\" they said.\\nThe clerics urged the government and its partners to provide necessary infrastructure, effective referral systems and human resources for health. \\nThey said increased skilled deliveries and quality of care is key in preventing maternal deaths caused by severe bleeding during delivery. ', ' \"Increased access to Antenatal care for pregnant women and post-natal care particularly for women living in rural settings would help address complications related to hypertension, and post-partum infections,\" read the statement. The clergy nevertheless recognised that ICPD25 has some items that are locally and contextually beneficial to the people. COMMITMENTS They committed to providing information and services on family planning/child spacing, to all persons, as is consistent with their faith values. “We, therefore, welcome our governments and the international community to partner with us in ensuring access to quality information and services,\" they added. Rev. Fr. Joseph Mutie of Inter-Religious Council of Kenya and Organisation of African Instituted Churches said the church will inform and educate all persons to eradicate all forms of sexual and gender-based violence. The teachings will also eliminate child, early and forced marriage, as well as female genital mutilation. Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims’ Sheikh Lattif Shaban, urged the government to desist from overtaxing citizens in the name of domestic resource mobilisation. \"We call on our governments to curb corruption by strengthening public policies, regulatory frameworks and financial management systems at all levels, unlocking the transformative potential of all people, particularly women, in economic development,\" Sheikh Shaban said. He said faith institutions remain committed to providing health information and services and urged African governments to expand the cover of national health insurance schemes. The faith actors called upon policymakers to strive for just societies, by including faith actors in decision-making forums that contribute to policy development. ', \" Belgian Ambassador Nicolas Nihon landed two years ago and today, he will celebrate his third King’s Day in Kenya.\\nHe and his wife enjoy very much the weather of Nairobi and the wildlife of Kenya. They appreciate to live in a place where the cultural and ethnic diversity is so rich and feel their son is blessed to grow up in such an environment.\\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Amb Nihon explained his country's approach to bilateral relations and what role they are playing in helping Kenya achieve its potential.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSome diplomatic missions represent their country in more than one Eastern African nation, and not just Kenya. Is yours one of those?\\nApart from UN Environment Programme and UN Habitat, my jurisdiction covers five additional countries: Somalia, Eritrea, Madagascar, the Comoros and the Seychelles. Belgium has a proper embassy in every Eastern African Nation, except in South Sudan. \\xa0\\nForeign diplomatic missions here in Nairobi can be roughly divided into two categories: those who offer official development assistance (ODA), which we might refer to as “the donor community” and who are very influential; and then those who are here primarily to represent their countries and to facilitate trade. In which category would you say Belgium belongs?\\nTo the second category, with a “donor” aspect, though. Kenya is the first destination for our state-to-state loans, which enable Belgian companies to build here noncommercially viable infrastructure, such as water boreholes, firefighting stations or medical waste treatment facilities. But these loans include a 35 per cent gift to the government of Kenya. Some of these companies are in Nairobi this week on the occasion of a new Belgian economic business mission. \", ' This shift from “aid to trade” is generally justified on the basis that Kenya is now a middle-income country, and no longer a developing nation as such. But if you look around you, there is plenty of poverty in Kenya, many communities who could do with some form of assistance from a rich country like yours. One cannot always be everywhere. Some countries are very poor in comparison to Kenya. This is why Belgium focuses its traditional development cooperation on a short list of “least developed countries”, like DR Congo, Mozambique or Mali.Your embassy has been active in the field of human rights in the recent past. Have there been any solid achievements in this respect, or has it mostly been a frustrating engagement for you and your staff?\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor two years, together with the Coalition of Human Rights Defenders of Kenya, Belgium co-chaired the EU Working Group, putting together European embassies and the Kenyan civil society representatives. We organised the 3rd edition of the Human Rights Defenders Awards, an important occasion to showcase Kenyans who stand up for the rights of their fellow citizens. Some are truly “Shujaas”. By the way, the next edition will take place on the 29th of November. My embassy has also been very supportive of the LGBTI community in Kenya.Frustrated? No. Passionate? Yes. But patient also because whatever we say or do, in the end, it is the Kenyan government and the civil society who, hand in hand, can progress towards the realisation of these universal rights. In that regard, I want to commend the Kenyan government for co-hosting with Denmark this month in Nairobi an international conference (ICPD+25), which will reaffirm women’ rights to decide about their own maternity.A strong case can be made that Kenya’s most critical national challenge is job creation. We have hundreds of thousands of perfectly well-qualified young people, who simply cannot find gainful employment. Is your embassy doing anything to help in this respect?We have no specific programme in Kenya for that. But let me tell you that this problem is not limited to your country. In a fast-changing world, many young people in Belgium find it hard to get a job. We have to somehow reinvent the entire system because school, work and life are not what they used to be.I note that young Kenyans can be very entrepreneurial. Being self-employed is probably the short-term solution because the government cannot create millions of jobs out of the blue. But what the government must do is foster a nurturing environment for start-ups and SMEs. ', ' While admittedly, we have too many well-educated but unemployed young people, if Kenya is to be globally competitive, we still need to have our young people seeking advanced studies abroad in fields where our local universities do not offer the requisite training. Do you offer scholarships and other such academic opportunities? \\xa0\\nWe do offer some scholarships for Master’s degrees, but our best line of action is in the field. For the past 12 years, indeed, Flemish universities (northern part of Belgium) have joined forces with your universities to reinforce their education and research capacities in the field of health, natural resource management and development, and food security. Upgrading Kenyan universities is the way forward, because you have the brains. But just like the Belgian students, Kenyans need the competition that studying abroad brings along.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads\\nWhat would you say are the key issues Kenya needs to improve on, if it is to attract more foreign investments?\\nCorruption is a plague and it deters companies to come here to settle for good. I am happy that His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta is determined to fight it tooth and nail.\\nThe second thing is to develop infrastructure. Kenya is on the right path, but as long as the Port of Mombasa, the SGR and the customs authorities do not work as a team to attend to the needs of importers and exporters, investment — foreign or local — will not bloom the way it should.\\nFinally, it is important to find a balance between the creation of jobs for Kenyans, which is crucial, and the swift issuing of work permits for foreigners involved in projects that in return foster local employment.\\nWhat has been the highlight of your time in Kenya thus far?\\nThe visit of Her Majesty Queen Mathilde of Belgium, who, as a Unicef ambassador, came last June to learn from and promote the projects of this UN agency in Kenya. Her extensive programme gave me the opportunity to interact with adolescents in difficult situations: children in a camp for refugees, teens from the slums or the streets, striving for their future, and Maasai girls who fled home from an early marriage or female genital mutilation. For me, who has such a privileged life, this was a very humbling experience.\\nWhat is one thing you are working on which you believe will enable you to say that, yes, you definitely contributed to making Kenya a better place during your time here? \\xa0\\nThat’s a tough one. I have a dream (laugh). I am trying to help “Friends of Karura” and KFS to connect the two sections of this forest that everybody knows in Nairobi.\\nThe duke of Burgundy Charles “the Bold”, who ruled the Low Countries in the 15th century, used to say, “One does not have to hope in order to try, and one does not have to succeed in order to persevere.”\\nEdited by Tom Jalio ', ' Deputy President William Ruto yesterday refused to take questions relating to his claims that Mt Kenya cabinet secretaries were plotting to eliminate him ahead of the 2022 elections.\\nThe DP brushed off attempts by a battery of journalists to get him to speak on the matter after a press conference on female genital mutilation at his Karen residence office in Nairobi.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads\\nInstead, the DP\\xa0 waved at journalists, turned his back and retreated into his office. His security guards then ordered journalists out of the compound.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe DP is also yet to record a statement with the DCI despite telling the President that his life was in danger.\\nOn Monday, cabinet secretaries Peter Munya, Sicily Kariuki and Joseph Mucheru appeared at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to record statements after a letter allegedly authored by a minister and revealing the alleged assassination plot, appeared online.\\nThe mystery letter had accused them of plotting to assassinate the Deputy President during a series of meetings held at Hotel La Mada.\\nThe DP made his first public appearance on the day a new audio clip surfaced on the internet purportedly by a PS who was explaining what transpired on May 14 when the CSs and other state officers met.\\n“People take the assassination conversation seriously because there is a background to it,” Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen, a close ally of Ruto, said.\\n“I said before there are people in the office of the President who do not want to see the President and Deputy President together. There have been direct instructions by the PS Interior Karanja Kibicho to county commissioners that they should not attend his meetings. Now you are being told there are meetings at La Mada,\" he added.\\nThe new audio clip, purportedly a recording of a sitting principal secretary, is likely to give the DCI detectives a fresh headache.\\nIt comes at a time when the sleuths are still scratching their heads over the authenticity of the letter that made the assassination claims against the DP.\\nTrade CS Peter Munya who is out of the country dismissed the contents of the recording insisting no such discussion took place.\\n\"The people who faked the letter are the same ones who have gone and released that audio,\" Munya said.\\nThe speaker in the audio claims they were summoned to a meeting at the La Mada Hotel through an SMS by Interior CS Kibicho.\\nHowever, no specific agenda was stated in the text.\\nAt the hotel, a man who ushered them in took away their phones, the clip alleges.\\xa0\\n\\xa0“As he walked us inside, he also asked that we leave our phones. He took our phones and I remember we walked together with a colleague of mine and a PS who had a laptop and it was also taken away,” the distorted male voice explains.\\nAccording to the alleged PS, he initially thought it was a meeting of the National Development Implementation Technical Committee chaired by Kibicho.\\nThe committee consisting of 11 PSs, the Solicitor General and the head of the Presidential Delivery Unit and supervises the implementation of government projects across the country.\\nHowever, at the meeting, the man claims it became clear that was not a normal government meeting.\\n“Some CS started coming, at that moment, it became clear it was not the technical committee. The technical committee does not have CSs,” he explains.\\nHe, however, notes that Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri was conspicuously absent.\\nBefore the meeting kicked off, he names a powerful woman who works at State House whom he says walked in.\\nThe said lady was the secretary, taking minutes during the meeting.\\n“She went directly to PS Kibicho and sat next to him and they had a conversation. The meeting was chaired by PS Interior. It was him who was in charge of the meeting,” the audio clip states.\\nThe man claims that the agenda of the meeting were three: Huduma Namba, the referendum and retaining power.\\nHowever, before delving into the first agendum, ICT CS Joe Mucheru stood up, briefly addressed the gathering saying he could not sit through the entire meeting.\\n“He [Mucheru] said he was going to the airport, he has a plane to catch. He wanted to fly to Rwanda where he said he had an ICT-related meeting,” the man claims.\\nHe goes on: “He then said he was going to be bound with [sic] what we discussed and he wished us well and so he left.”\\nMucheru alongside CSs Peter Munya (Industrialisation) Sicily Kariuki (Health) and James Macharia (Transport) were summoned by the DCI on Monday to record statements on the alleged murder plot against Ruto.\\nAccording to the audio, leaders at the meeting were asked to return to their rural homes and mobilise their backyards for the registration of Huduma Namba.\\nLeaders were told that a referendum would be conducted before 2022 despite opposition by the Ruto brigade.\\n“They told us the referendum was going to happen whether Deputy President Ruto wanted it or not. They told us to go to our villages where we were born and whip up emotion, ask people to support the referendum when it comes,” the man in the audio claims.\\nHe quotes one of the speakers in the meeting who confidently suggested that the state would rig the referendum if it proved a hard tackle.\\n“Once the referendum was done, even if the side that the government was going to support did not win, they were going to rig it […] he said that is why we should go and help people in the villages to register for Huduma number so that when the time to rig comes, we will use it to rig, whatever it takes,” he quotes the speaker.\\nThe said speaker went on to chest thump that power will never leave Mt Kenya.\\nThe audio refers to another CS who allegedly told the meeting that “no African President has ever relinquished power”.\\n“He gave some examples including Museveni and he said we have to do everything to stop Ruto,” he quotes the CS.\\nTo reinforce his point, a controversial PS allegedly stood up and said they would do anything to stop the DP.\\xa0\\n“To stop Ruto includes doing the impossible, including you know what happened to Saitoti,” the audio claims.\\nThe PS also allegedly threatened that MPs from Mt Kenya who are allies of the DP would be crushed.\\nIn the letter that has been doing rounds on social media and which is a subject of an investigation by the DCI, the issue of retaining power and the Huduma Namba was not mentioned.\\nOn Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen said Munya talked to Ruto with an unacceptably condescending attitude.\\nHe also accused Kibicho of ordering county commissioners to keep away from Ruto’s meetings\\n“A PS having the audacity, first of all, to withdraw county commissioners attending the DP\\'s meetings and thereafter to purport to be reporting the DP to the DCI. Honesty in which country in the world?”Murkomen said.\\nHe went on, “The President doesn\\'t need criminal culpability to act. This is just a simple administrative action.
