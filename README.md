### Content
  * Python_EDA.ipynb : This project was to develop the predictive model to identify the crucial factors affecting housing prices in the United States using Python. It includes how I imported data (e.g. calling APIs and converting JSON format into CSV), perform transformation/aggregation, create visualizations, and build models. 
  
  * Python_Scraping.ipynb & Python_Topic Modeling NLP.ipynb: This project was to scrape news ariticles from African countries website and visualize with WordCloud and build the Topic Model using Machine Learning and NLP techniques to discover the abstract "topics" in a collection of documents. 
  
  * Python_ETL.ipynb & SQL_Schema.sql : This project was to develop a data pipeline using ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) which enables to process data automatically. I used MongoDB to store scraped data from Sephora website (EXTRACT), cleaned and aggregated using Python Pandas dataframe (TRANSFORM), and load back to MySQL after creating database schema in SQL (LOAD).    
  
  * SQL_Project.sql : This project shows example of how I am managing/transforming data in relational DB, MySQL using SQL.
  
  * RL_OpenAI Gym.ipynb: This code shows part of the project implementing and training an agent to successfully land the "Lunar Lander" in OpenAI gym using Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
