  * Python Project_SL.ipynb : This project was to develop the predictive model to identify the crucial factors affecting housing prices in the United States using Python. It includes how I imported data (e.g. calling APIs and converting JSON format into CSV), perform transformation/aggregation, create visualizations, and build models. 
  * ETL Project_SL.ipynb & ETL Project Schema_SL.sql : This project was to develop a data pipeline using ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) which enables to process data automatically. I used MongoDB to store scraped data from Sephora (EXTRACT), cleaned and aggregated using Python Pandas dataframe (TRANSFORM), and load back to MySQL after creating database schema in SQL (LOAD).    
  * SQL Project_SL.sql : This project shows example of how I am managing/transforming data in relational DB, MySQL using SQL.
